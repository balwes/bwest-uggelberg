				<p>The graph visualizes the spread of COVID-19 in Sweden. Use the buttons above the graph to show/hide lines. Use the date inputs to view specific time frames. You can see the predicted spread by giving an end date in the future (this feature is primitive, read "Details" for an elaboration).</p>
				<h1 class="smaller">Details</h1>
				<p>The data displayed in this graph follows the SIR model. SIR categorizes humans as either (1) Suspectible, those who can be infected, (2) Infected, those who are infected and can infect others, and (3) Removed, those who have had the disease. Note that "removed" also includes deceased individuals. Prediction is performed when the end date is in the future. It is based on data from the previous few days, check the source code on GitHub for more.</p>
				<h1 class="smaller">Limitations</h1>
				<p>This website was made for a course in computer science and should not be substituted for information from health organizations. Please view this page as an introduction to SIR modeling using COVID-19 data. Keep in mind that models are a simplification of reality. For example, all predictions on this page do not take preventative measures into account. Because of this, the graph becomes less accurate the longer it attempts to predict.</p>
