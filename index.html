				<h1 class="smaller">General Information</h1>
				<p>The graph visualizes the spread of COVID-19 in Sweden. Use the buttons above the graph to show/hide lines. Use the date inputs to view specific time frames. Place the end date far in the future to see what might happen.</p>
				<p>The data displayed in this graph follows the SIR model. SIR categorizes humans as either (1) Suspectible, those who can be infected, (2) Infected, those who are infected and can infect others, and (3) Removed, those who have had the disease. Note that "removed" also includes deceased individuals.</p>
				<h1 class="smaller">Prediction</h1>
				<p>To predict future numbers we use the data from the previous month and take the average rate of change between the days. This tweaks the variables of infection rate and removal rate. The rates at which people are getting infected or stop being infected (either by dying or recovering). Naturally, if people are getting infected faster than getting removed then the number of infected people will grow and vice versa. If you've ever heard about "flattening the curve", the red line on this page (showcasing the number of simultaneously infected individuals) is that curve.</p>
				<h1 class="smaller">Limitations</h1>
				<p>This website was made for a course in computer science and is not a substitute for information from health organizations. Please view this page as an introduction to SIR modeling using COVID-19 data. Keep in mind that models are a simplification of reality. The data used is also far from optimal. Since Sweden (at least as of writing) does not conduct a lot of tests the data on which the prediction is based is flawed.</p>
				<p>We'd like to note that Swedish statistics, specifically, might make the graph look a bit strange. As of writing this it seems that people are not declared as recovered at a steady pace but rather in batches. This makes the graph look jagged. Also, it might make the graph more pessimistic.</p>
